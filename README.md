# C
C mini projects. Code written with the sole purpose of learning the langauge and the computer science concepts below its surface. I will be using this repo to record my progress in C into the future.

#### int_array.c
Learning the syntax and memory mechanics of int arrays in c.

#### llama.c
A problem involving user input, while loops and do-while loops. Starting at n={insert number}, how many years does it take for a llama population to grow to N={insert number here}?

#### set_a_password.c
Practice using dynamic memory allocation.

#### int_passcode_cases.c
Practice using, amongst other things, cases, do-wile loops, dynamic memory, fgets and looping over strings.

#### counting_words.c
Counting the words in a text message. An exploration of the use of pointers to change a variables value by simply pointing to different points in memory.

#### password_login_2.c
A 4 digit passcode login page. Allows any character, and any number of characters as input. Warns the passcode must be 4 digits and all numbers. Gives 10 attempts.

#### pointer_types_ASCII.c
A script displaying the importance of pointer type. Gives a key insight into how the computer stores and accesses letters and integers.
