# Beginner-C
A couple of C beginner mini projects. Code written in the early stages of learning. I will be using this repo to record my progress in C into the future.

#### int_array.c
Learning the syntax and memory mechanics of int arrays in c.

#### llama.c
A problem involving user input, while loops and do-while loops. Starting at n={insert number}, how many years does it take for a llama population to grow to N={insert number here}?

#### set_a_password.c
Practice using dynamic memory allocation.
